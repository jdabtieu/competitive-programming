## Problem Description
### DMOJ Capture The Flag '20 B3 - Classic Buffer Overflow
Classic buffer overflow, should be easy, right? To make this even more easier, we're printing the address of the function you're supposed to call.

[main.c](https://static.dmoj.ca/data/ctf/ectf20/3a94daa70dec9724331681ac2d16f3b6-main.c) `3a94daa70dec9724331681ac2d16f3b6` `437B`<br>
[main](https://static.dmoj.ca/data/ctf/ectf20/98972d672b0bcd184c0c6769bb083863-main) `98972d672b0bcd184c0c6769bb083863` `15K`

The judge will run `main.c`. You must interact with the judge with a solution through the standard input and output streams. Anything the judge outputs will be in your standard input stream, and anything you output to standard output will be forwarded to the judge as input. If your solution successfully causes the judge to print the flag to its standard error stream, you will receive AC. Otherwise, you will receive WA. Note that at no point during the judging will your program receive the flag. Additionally, the judge does not need to exit with an exit code of 0. It can exit with anything.
