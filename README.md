This repository contains all of the programs I submitted to DMOJ (dmoj\.ca), including CCC problems\.


Source code locations:

root\\CATEGORY\\DMOJ-POINT-VALUE EXACT NAME\\src\\\*\.\*

or if \\src\\ doesn't exist, root\\CATEGORY\\DMOJ-POINT-VALUE EXACT-NAME\\\*\.\*

EXACT NAME is the name the problem has on DMOJ, minus any non-alphanumeric or space characters\.
It also does not include problem number (eg\. P1) for all contests except ones with seperate Junior/Senior sections\.
